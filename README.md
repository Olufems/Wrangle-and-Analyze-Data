# Data Wrangling and Analysis
This is the data wrangling and analysis project for the Udacity Data Analyst nano-degree program, called WeRateDog.
This project details the process of wrangling a tweet archive from the Twitter user @dog rates, commonly known as WeRateDogs. 
The dataset was separated into three sections: 
•	The first upgraded Twitter archive of 2356 tweets, including basic tweet data, rating, dog name, and dog "stage." 
•	Next, more data from the Twitter API, containing interesting columns such as retweet count and favorite count. 
•	Image Predictions Database.

After cleaning and wrangling the individual dataset, it was then read into a pandas dataframe and saved as a master dataset for the Twitter archive. The following research issues were addressed:
•	What month and year had the most and least tweets?  
•	Which dogs (by name) had the highest average rating (%) in the top 15?  
•	Which dog has received the most retweets and likes (favorite)?  
•	Is there a link between the number of retweets and the likes?
